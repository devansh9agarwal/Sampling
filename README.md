# Making 5 samples using different techniques and using 5 different models on each
In this notebook, 5 samples have been created using different sampling techniques namely Random Sampling without Replacement, Random Sampling with Replacement, Systematic Sampling, Cluster Sampling, Stratified Sampling. 
Furthur, these samples have been used to evaluate 5 different classification models, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression.

The given data was highly imbalanced.

To balance the data, I have applied oversampling.
